                        <p>Tricked into assassinating his own prospective father-in-law, righteous samurai Raizou Kurima is overwhelmed with guilt. In order to reclaim his honor, Raizou swears vengeance on the lord who gave him those misleading orders. In his pursuit, he is aided by self-proclaimed merchant-of-all-trades Yuuen Usui, who is actually one of the Revengers‚Äîassassins who seek justice for the wronged and dispense bloody revenge on their behalf. <strong>If you like nice violence and bloodshed, I highly recommend this to you</strong>.</p>
